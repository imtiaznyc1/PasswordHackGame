<br><BLOCKQUOTE>So I have seen lately that your grades have been falling like the 
				London Bridge. This is a disgrace to our constitution and work ethics.
				Look, I know you want to succeed as a student, but you don't seem to 
				have the intellect to do so. Since I kind of care for you, I will give
				you a chance to change your grades (literally). Press the button on the
				bottom of this message and it will take you to a site. There you will
				be given four tries to guess a passcode. I believe there are hints given,
				but don't kill me if they don't. If you can gues this passcode correctly, 
				your grades on PupilPath will be changed to a 99%. You may be wondering why
				they can't give 100%. Well, let's just say you have to do something more 
				rigourous for that one percent, skydiving from outer space, which you can't 
				do. GOOD LUCK! (not really) <a href="RI_MK_game.html"><span id="button2">PASSCODE HACK</span></a></div>
